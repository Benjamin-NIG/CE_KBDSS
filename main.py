        This application is designed to collect insights on the adoption of circular economy principles in the building construction industry. 
        Participants are asked to rate their level of agreement with various decision-making factors (DMFs) that influence circular economy integration across different phases and aspects of construction projects.
        
        **Instructions:**
        - For each DMF, select your level of agreement from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates strong disagreement and 5 indicates strong agreement.
        - Your responses will help in understanding the current trends and challenges in implementing circular economy practices in the construction sector.

        **System Overview:**      
        -Welcome to the KBDSS for construction project circularity decision making. 
        This application is designed to collect insights on the adoption of circular economy principles in the building construction industry.
        This interactive platform is designed to assist your CE implementaion decision making
        and also provide your with automated action plan based on your circularity index. The KBDSS involves the computation of CE suitability index based on the DMFs in 
        5 categories(phase of integration, environmental consideration,organisational attributes,project team capacity and project feature and circular design)""")
  
    st.image('kbdss.jpg', caption='KBDSS flow') 
    
    st.markdown("""
        **How was it developed:**   
        -The automated KBDSS adopted a robust streamlit framework for its development. It leveraged the DMFs for CE adoption in construction projects. 
        An empirical questionnaire was employed to collect data on DMFs from subject matter experts. The data were analysed and the CE suitability were computed 
        for the 5 themes of DMFs. The index generated and the action plan for improvement gathered from literature and interview were deployed into the streamlit framework
        to develop the KBDSS for project circularity.
        

        **What does it do:** 
        -By inputting data across phase of integration, environmental consideration,organisational attributes,
        project team capacity and project feature and circular design, users can receive the circularity index for their project. Based on the circularity index, 
        action plan tailored towards improving the circularity decision making for the project will be automated.
        
        **How to use it:** 
        -Navigate through the sidebar and input data to rate their level of agreement with various decision-making factors (DMFs) for circular economy 
        integration across different phases and aspects of construction projects.
        For each DMF, select your level of agreement from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates strong disagreement and 5 indicates strong agreement.
        
        Enjoy exploring the opportunities and insights offered by this automated platform.
